The function
this function is called for each thread inside the array of blocks
each thread is responsible for a single output node computation for all filters.
coordinates are defined as the following:
x: image number
y: y coordinate of the output node
z: x coordinate of the output node

output array: x,y,z same as above, last param is the number oh channels

Dimensions calculation:
GRID
I tried some different combinations such as using z as filter index (see main.cu) and many others but ended up with this.
given the input array numbers and dimensions we make sure of the following:

x: covers the number of image
y: covers the height of the image
z: covers the widh of the image

THREAD
8x8x1 because smaller block size has several benefits such as efficient Shared Memory usage, wrap Efficiency ..etc
