### Algorithm: Convolutional Neural Network Training and Testing

#### 1. Initialization:

- Import necessary libraries including TensorFlow, NumPy, and CUDA for GPU acceleration.
- Define CUDA kernels for manual convolution, max-pooling, and their backward passes.
- Define classes for convolution and fully connected layers.
- Define loss functions (cross-entropy loss and its gradient).
- Load and preprocess the MNIST dataset.

#### 2. Training Function (`train_network()`):

- Iterate through each epoch (number of complete passes through the dataset).
- Initialize total loss and correct predictions to zero.
- Create batches of training data and labels.
- For each batch:

  - Perform forward pass:

    - Apply manual convolution on the batch using CUDA kernel to get convolutional output.
    - Apply max-pooling on the batch using CUDA kernel to downsample the output.
    - Feed the pooled output to the fully connected layer.
    - for each input:
      - flatten it, and pass it through FC layer and apply softmax activation to get prediction.
      - Compute loss, update total loss, and track correct predictions.

  - Perform backward pass:

    - For each input:

      - Backpropagate the gradient through FC layer
      - store each gradients in a temporary list

    - Feed the list of all gradients from FC layer to the max-pooling layer.
    - Backpropagate gradients through max-pooling layer using CUDA kernel.
    - Backpropagate gradients through convolutional layer using CUDA kernel.
    - Update convolutional filters based on gradients.

- Calculate average loss and accuracy for the epoch.
- Print epoch number, time taken, loss, and accuracy.

#### 3. Testing Function:

- Use trained model parameters for testing.
- Apply convolution using CUDA kernel to get convolutional output for test data.
- Apply max-pooling using CUDA kernel to downsample the output.
- Feed the pooled output to the fully connected layer for predictions.
- Calculate accuracy by comparing predicted labels with true labels.

#### 4. Conclusion:

- Print the time taken for training and testing.
- Print the final accuracy of the model.

#### 5. End.
